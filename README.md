# Self Hypnosis App

This repository contains a native Android (Kotlin) prototype for a self-hypnosis app with a frequency/session library and a simple session player.

What is included
- `android/` — native Android project skeleton (Kotlin): app module, resources, and `MainActivity` that loads `frequency.json` from assets.
- `create_tree.sh` — script to create the project directory tree (if needed).
- `assets/`, `src/`, `templates/`, `docs/` — workspace layout and other project files.

Getting started
1. Open the `android/` folder in Android Studio and let it sync.
2. Build and run on a device or emulator.

See `android/README_ANDROID.md` for detailed build and signing instructions.

If you want me to create the remote GitHub repository and push the code, I can attempt it (I will need your confirmation and `gh` authentication on your machine), or you can run the commands I provide below.
