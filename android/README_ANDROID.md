Self Hypnosis Android (Kotlin) - Quick Start

What I added
- A minimal native Android project skeleton under `android/`:
  - `settings.gradle`, `build.gradle` (root)
  - `app/` module with `build.gradle`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, resources and a `MainActivity.kt` that loads sessions from an asset file.

How to build (recommended)
1. Install Android Studio (Linux) and ensure Android SDK & a recent JDK are installed.
2. Open Android Studio, choose "Open an existing project" and select this repository's `android/` folder.
3. Let Android Studio sync Gradle and download required components.
4. Build an APK via Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s) or run on a connected device.

Command-line build (advanced)
- After Android Studio syncs, you can build with Gradle. If a Gradle wrapper is not present, Android Studio will help create one. From the `android/` folder you can run:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

Release signing (short)
- To prepare a production APK suitable for Play Store, create a release keystore and sign the APK. Example:

```bash
# generate a keystore (run once)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -alias mykey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# sign with jarsigner (or configure signing in Gradle)
jarsigner -keystore release.keystore app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk mykey

# align and optimize
zipalign -v -p 4 app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk app-release.apk
```

Notes and next steps
- I added `frequency.json` under `app/src/main/assets/` and updated `MainActivity` to load sessions at runtime. The app now dynamically shows available sessions and plays isochronic/burst/binaural tones with TTS suggestions.
- This is a prototype. For a sellable product you should:
  - Replace demo carriers with carefully tested, medically-informed tone generators and consult an expert.
  - Add UI polish, icons, onboarding, privacy policy, and analytics as needed for the Play Store.
  - Implement user consent and safety notices.

Want me to:
- Add a Gradle wrapper and CI-friendly build script so you can run builds without Android Studio? (I can add wrapper files, but the wrapper JAR is large — best generated by Gradle on your machine or by Android Studio.)
- Implement persistent templates and a simple save/load UI?
- Add Play Store publishing steps and a checklist for release?

- After Android Studio syncs, you can build with Gradle wrapper. If a wrapper is not present, Android Studio will provide one.

Notes and next steps
- This is a minimal demo: the audio generator uses an audible carrier (440 Hz) amplitude-modulated by a low-frequency pulse (session mapping: 8–10 Hz). Real entrainment uses carefully shaped carriers and filtering — treat this as a prototype.
- I can extend this by adding a `frequency.json` mapping, session templates, persistent storage, and improved tone shaping (isochronic pulses, binaural/monaural carriers).
